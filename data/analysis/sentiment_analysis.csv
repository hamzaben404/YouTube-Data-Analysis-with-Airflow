2nBlXHXlvto,A new way of ‘writing’ that feels more like a walk in the park 🌳,"Writing can feel like assembling a jigsaw puzzle without the picture—especially when you’re stuck at a desk, staring at a blank screen. I used to get hit with writer’s block constantly. Now, I’m VoicePalling my ideas: I grab my phone, go for a walk, and let VoicePal capture my thoughts while I get my steps in.

There’s something about being outdoors that just makes ideas flow easier. Walking, breathing fresh air, taking in the surroundings—it’s not about ‘writing’ anymore, but just talking through my ideas. Then VoicePal turns it all into a first draft that actually sounds like me.

If you’re ready to try a new way of ‘writing’ that feels more like a walk in the park (literally), search VoicePal on the App Store or Play Store :)

Running a team, making videos, and doing podcasts meant I had all these ideas, but staring at a blank screen just didn’t work. I even thought about hiring a ghostwriter, but that would’ve cost me $5K a month 😳

That’s why my team and I built VoicePal—a ghostwriter in your pocket. Now, I just talk through my ideas while walking, and the app turns them into a first draft that sounds like me.

I’ve been using it daily for my videos, newsletters, and even my next book. It’s a total game-changer! 🚀

w_XIJOlklrs,The New Productivity App I've Built 😊,"Staring at a blank screen just wasn’t working, and being stuck at my desk all day killed my motivation.

I wish I had it when I wrote the book, it would've made things quicker and more enjoyable. Now I use it for my newsletter, LifeNotes, and brainstorming video ideas. It’s been a real game-changer.

This video does not represent financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. When investing, your capital is at risk. Investments can rise and fall and you may get back less than you invested. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Free shares can be fractional. *Terms and fees apply - https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest. 

The other day I had a conversation with someone about their financial goals. It sparked the idea for this video, where I share my honest advice to anyone who wants to hit financial freedom. I hope you get some value out of it! Enjoy x

Hey friends. So this is a 3 hour evidence-based studying course that I filmed a few years ago and put on Skillshare, but now I want to make it available to everyone for free. In this class, I'll take you through the well-kept secrets of how to study effectively and organise your workflow to be ready for exams when they come around. We'll also discuss why studying effectively and efficiently is one of the best ways to maintain a work-life balance. 

We'll break down (1) how to understand our content using techniques like the Feynman Method, Active Recall and various note-taking strategies, (2) how to remember our material with Spaced Repetition, Interleaving and various memory techniques, and (3) how to maintain focus while studying, from developing the motivation and discipline to do the work, to taking appropriate breaks and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Last month, I spoke to Alex Lieberman about how starting a newsletter completely changed his life. He started Morning Brew in college and eventually sold it for $70 million. I haven't quite made the same amount from my newsletter lol but the single best decision I've made as a creator has been starting a newsletter because it's led to everything else. So in this video, I wanted to break down you should start, what you can actually write about and how to get started.

T6hmdrsLQj8,How to Build Your Ultimate Productivity System,"📚 Pre-order my book to get an exclusive ticket to The Feel-Good Productivity Annual Planning Workshop in January 2024! https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/?utm_campaign=bonus&utm_source=youtube_long&utm_medium=video_description&utm_content=How+to+Build+the+Ultimate+Productivity+System+%282023%29

The whole point of a productivity system is to get your life in order and free up valuable brain space. No one wants to be spending tons of time organising emails or searching for a book quote that they forgot to highlight. 

There are broadly three levels of building an ultimate productivity system: keeping your life in order, capturing new info, and creating a system around it. You can stop at layer one or use all three. I cover it all in more detail in this video, including suggestions for apps that I like to use daily.

ngWZaSbw130,Why Buying Is Not Always Better Than Renting,"So you've probably heard the phrase ""renting is money down the drain"" and you've probably been told your whole life, that you should get on the property ladder and buy a home, because once you've bought a home, then you're saving money and it's an investment and stuff, and hey, at least you're not renting anymore and throwing all that money away. 

BUT it's actually a lot more complicated than that. BOTH buying and renting have costs, both financial and psychological, and those are the factors we need to take into account which I'll be discussing in this episode of Money Club.

In this video you’ll get an in-depth look under the hood of my digital setup. Productivity is about using our time intentionally and effectively: over the years I’ve refined this system to help me run multiple businesses, grow a YouTube channel, start a podcast, and write a book. In a previous life it also helped me graduate from medical school, and still get things done while working as a doctor.

mVR_nLBeS24,"Which iPad Should You Buy? (Basic, Mini, Air, Pro or Pro 12.9)","In this video, I'll be going over all the iPad models out there in 2022 and which would be the best to buy right now as a consumer, creator or professional.

My upfront conclusion is that if you're a consumer/student then the basic iPad is your best friend. If you're a light creator then you should probably go with the iPad Air (2022, M1) and if you're a creator / professional of some kind, then the iPad Pro (11"" & 12.9"") is for you.

nQggHK36gK8,"Reviewing Kindles - Standard, Paperwhite, Signature, Oasis","Try out Loom, the screen recording software the team and I use daily 👉  https://loom.com/aliabdaal

Hey friends, in this video, we're taking a quick look at Amazon's newly released Kindles and which one I recommend you buy for 2022! Upfront, my conclusion is that you should go for the Paperwhite, but the standard kindle is also pretty good and much cheaper, it just comes with a few compromises. The Signature and Oasis are both pretty ridiculous unless you have money to burn or a very niche use-case. Hopefully this video helps with your decision! Enjoy xx

Toz7XEsSH_o,How Much Money I Make as a YouTuber (2021)💰,"If you want to start or grow a channel, check out my Part-Time YouTuber Academy here: https://ptya.com/part-time-youtuber-academy

In this ridiculously long and detailed video, I'll take you behind-the-scenes of my YouTube channel and various businesses to show how much money we've made in 2021. Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account and please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty.

If you've got any questions, chuck them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer. 

PS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it goes into a company account which I then pay 21 team members, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions etc. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this ""top line business revenue"" has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :)

I never used to be a huge fan of goals. They just seemed a bit pointless compared to the value of a robust system. But over the past year speaking to different experts, I've come to realise that there may be more to this whole goal thing than I previously thought.

In this ridiculously long and detailed video, I'll take you behind-the-scenes of my Youtube channel and various businesses to show how much money we've made in 2020. Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account. And please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty. 

If you've got any questions, chuck them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer. 

🧠 The Part-Time YouTuber Academy - https://academy.aliabdaal.com

PS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it all goes into a company account. Then I pay salaries for 2.5 full time employees, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this ""top line business revenue"" has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :)

In the video, we look at the three key areas that Jay identifies as key to this process - Letting Go, Growing and Giving - and why, in our hectic modern world, it is more important than ever to find ways of managing our thoughts to reduce stress, improve focus, and offer our service to the world.

In this episode of book club we're looking at the best selling book The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday which looks at how we use the ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism to help us turn adversity to our advantage. In the video, we look at the three key areas that Ryan identifies as key to this process - Perception, Action and Will - and discuss some examples of people who have successfully overcome adversity by leveraging the hidden benefits of obstacles to their advantage.

Hey friends, I'm pleased to bring you my latest SkillShare class that's being released today - How to Be Happier - A Stoicism Masterclass. I've taken great value from some of the principles of Stoicism over the past few years and so I decided to get together with my friend Sam, who is an expert on the ancient Greek philosophy, to put together this class. Over the course of 12 lessons, we explore the key themes of Stoicism as well as explain how to apply Stoic principles to your own life to foster happier and healthier lives as a result. I really hope you enjoy it!

11:50 ""If you would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train him before it comes""
14:25 ""When you are alone, you should call this tranquility and freedom and when you are with many you shouldn't call a crowd, or trouble or uneasiness but festival and company and contentedly accept it"".

Giving What We Can: https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/

“I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.” #TakeThePledge #GivingWhatWeCan

To improve your thinking and learning skills with active recall, visit https://brilliant.org/ali and sign up for free. The first 200 people will get 20% off the annual Premium subscription :)

In this video, we're taking a look at the method that my friend Osaid used to rank 1st at Cambridge University Medical School. He was consistently in the top 3 overall, and ranked 1st in several subjects using this method. It involves taking Active Recall to its logical extreme (the most efficient study technique, backed by decades of evidence).

In this video, I talk through 10 tips that I picked up while building and running a business through medical school. My company 6med (https://6med.co.uk) does around £150,000 in annual revenue and was built by me and my friends while we were medical students at Cambridge University. We talk about the importance of not waiting for permission, standing on the shoulders of giants, learning to code and design, working with friends, starting small, doing things that don't scale, expecting and learning from failure, starting with why, but above all, just starting. Enjoy!

If you've dreamed of starting a YouTube channel but haven't got an expensive camera and gear yet, this video's for you. We talk over my top tips for filming quality videos with your iPhone / Android using the app Filmic Pro. The audio is probably the most important part - I'd highly recommend using the Rode VideoMicro to start with, and you can always graduate to an external audio setup (like I have) later on. Good luck with your journey!

Lots of the comments were about money and relationships, but there were a few about how I'm going bald, how arrogant I come across in videos and how I probably went to private school.

📝My favourite iPad Screen Protector - Paperlike - https://paperlike.com/ali

In this video, I discuss the 4 main ways in which I use my iPad Pro in my daily work as a junior doctor. I talk about (1) how I use Goodnotes and the Dash Plus Productivity System to manage my to-do lists, (2) the magic of electronic medical records, (3) the power of being able to look stuff up on the fly, and (4) the beauty of productive downtime. Enjoy xx

PS: Eagle-eyed viewers might realise that this is a re-upload. The original video I posted in early 2019 missed the mark in terms of taking issues like data protection seriously. I hope this new version addresses some of those issues while also showing what a benefit technology like the iPad provides in clinical settings.

In today's Tech Tuesdays, we discuss recommendations for which iPad is best for which people. I conclude that the iPad Mini is best for those who use an iPad for purely consumption purposes, but if you're a student, or if you use it for any creative purposes, you'd probably be best served with the iPad Air (2019). 

If you're on a tight budget, the iPad ($319) is a pretty solid shout, and if you have a tonne of spare cash to burn, you can't get much better than the iPad Pro.

We end with a lovely evening of board games and food, courtesy of Just Eat, who are very kindly sponsoring the video. Enjoy xx

In this episode, I chat with fellow Cambridge YouTuber Parth G about lessons that we learned while at university. There's a second video on his channel of the two of us chatting about study tips which you might like to check out:

Slightly different episode from the usual today. A little while ago, I spent a few days in Grenada, an island in the Caribbean. On one of the days, I visited St George's University, a medical school in the capital city to experience life as a medical student in Grenada. I had a wonderful time being shown around by an old friend, and got some pretty sweet shots of the beautiful island. Enjoy xx

In this video, we talk about my strategy for taking notes with the iPad and Apple Pencil. I use an iPad Pro but would probably recommend the new 2018 iPad with Apple Pencil if you're buying a new one. We talk about the benefits of taking notes with an iPad vs traditional methods, we talk about Notability vs OneNote (I prefer Notability), and I share various techniques of note-taking that I use in lectures, seminars and hospital placements. Enjoy xx

Each year, clinical medical students (Years 4-6) at Cambridge University put on a pantomime to raise money for charity. In 2018, we performed “The Prion King” and raised over £10,000 for the Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres. 

It follows the story of Simbastatin (a 4th year medical student) and his friends as they navigate their first experiences of life on the wards. The evil villain Scarcoma (a paediatric surgeon-turned forensic pathologist) and his team of feral politicians plot to overthrow the dean of the Cambridge clinical school by unleashing the deadly Prion Disease. 

Each year, panto is written, directed, arranged, choreographed and performed by medical students. It’s always an incredible experience for those of us involved in it, and a great way of making friends across year groups. This year, for the first time, we’re putting the musical performances up on YouTube - enjoy!

SONG #2 - WE JUST CAN’T WAIT TO BEGIN

The second song introduces our main cast of ‘good guys’ - Simbastatin, Naloxone, Cornelius, Shelly and Minnie, as well as a load of other students all placed on the same ward in the hospital. The students are filled with naive joy about what life in clinical school is like, and expect they’ll be saving lives as an integral part of the clinical team on a daily basis. This song is a culmination of their continued optimism.

OTHER SONGS:

1. Another day of fun (La La Land) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-QC4mT8bXA
2. We just can’t wait to begin (The Lion King) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBANvzdbY_s

LYRICS:

[NALA] Clinical school’s finally here,
The day we’ve waited for 
[SIMBA] It’s gonna rule that much is clear
Preclin was such a bore

[SIMBA] I bet this is a piece of cake, 
The wards sound like a laugh,
[RAFIKI] Just wait until you’re an F1
We’re always understaffed

[ALL] Lectures prepared us for anything
Oh we just can’t wait to begin!

[MINNIE] Ordering blood tests
([SHELLY] what was that dear?)
[NALA] Analysing CTs
([SIMBA] what are they?)
[CORNELIUS] chatting up patients
([ZAZUSAN] excuse me?)
[S, N, M, C, Sh] It’ll be a bre--eze
([ZAZU] now see here!)

[S, N, M, C, Sh] Always finish by midday
([ZAZU] A patient a day keeps failure--(interrupted))
[S, N, M, C, Sh] We’ll have so much time to play

[CORNELIUS] (arm over Nala) I wonder if on my first day I’ll break a patient’s heart
[NALA] First you’d need a bath and sort that smell out for a start

[DOCTOR] (surrounded by ridiculous number of students) If this is where our hospital 
Is headed, count me out!
I hate students
And Savannahbrooke’s 
There’s private work about!!

[ZAZU] (flaps after her) We’re sending half the students to King’s Lynn!
[ALL] Oh we just can’t wait to begin!

[Sh+C] Learning on the ward rounds
[MINNIE] Helping run the clinics
[SIMBA] Acting in the theatres (everyone stares at him)
[NALA] Simba you are so thick (friendly)

[ALL] We’re finally meeting patients what a dream
Consultants will all want us on their team
We’re gonna save so many lives, you’ll see
Oh we just can’t wait to begin!
Oh we just can’t wait to begin!
Oh we just can’t wait to begin!

TIMESTAMPS

00:55 - We know that AR and SR are legit techniques for recalling stuff, but before you can recall it you have to have learnt it first. Any tips on *learning* stuff initially? 
06:57 - Exams are a month away. Any last minute tips, what you’d be doing?
10:55 - Any tips on how to learn content quickly? Exams are a month away and we haven’t even finished some of our courses yet. 
11:29 - How do your techniques change 1 month 2 weeks 1 week before the exam?
12:46 - With active recall, do you make the questions as you read the book? Or do you make notes from the textbook first, and then read them, and then quiz yourself? How do you do it?
14:21 - How should I use active recall? Do past papers count. 
14:46 - If you have Anki why do you still use your spreadsheet method? Surely you can do all that stuff on Anki with custom decks and filters and stuff. How do you decide what goes on Anki and what goes on Google Sheets?

## Subject Specific
18:37 - How do you apply flashcards/Anki for essay based subjects like History and English Lit? I find they’re working well for Biology but not sure how to use them for analysis subjects.

G-QC4mT8bXA,Another Day of Fun (La La Land) - The Prion King | Addenbrooke’s Hospital Pantomime 2018,"THE ADDENBROOKE’S PANTOMIME

Each year, clinical medical students (Years 4-6) at Cambridge University put on a pantomime to raise money for charity. In 2018, we performed “The Prion King” and raised over £10,000 for the Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres. 

It follows the story of Simbastatin (a 4th year medical student) and his friends as they navigate their first experiences of life on the wards. The evil villain Scarcoma (a paediatric surgeon-turned forensic pathologist) and his team of feral politicians plot to overthrow the dean of the Cambridge clinical school by unleashing the deadly Prion Disease. 

Each year, panto is written, directed, arranged, choreographed and performed by medical students. It’s always an incredible experience for those of us involved in it, and a great way of making friends across year groups. This year, for the first time, we’re putting the musical performances up on YouTube - enjoy!

SONG #1 - ANOTHER DAY OF FUN

The opening number shows the new 4th year clinical students arriving in Savannahbrooke’s Hospital and trying to navigate their new environment. They’ve spent the past 3 years of preclinical medicine practically living in the library, but are about to meet real patients for the first time. Filled with blind optimism, they burst into La La Land-inspired song. It’s another day of fun.

LYRICS:
(Explanations in footnotes)

We’re back for our first day
We’re going to start clinical school
Patients better pray
We are so excited, but we still don’t have a clue
No one has told us what to do
We wish we knew [1]

Summer’s at an end
These CPC’s [2] are going to 
Drive me around the bend,
And my placement plan [3]
Just seems so random and bizarre, 
I think I’m gonna need a car
King’s Lynn [4] is way too far!

Hope my GP’s somewhere near [5]
Is he even in our year?
Not sure what I’m doing here
We’ll have to see

What the hell’s the GMC? [6]
Are they friend or foe to me?
Where do I find my ward? 
Do I have to go in?!

In hospital
Always have to run
So we find everyone with signs [7]                                                                                                            
Why’d I live in town? [8]
(It’s another day of fun)
I’m always late and now
(It’s another day of fun)
This lanyard’s going brown
And it’s another day of fun!

Climb Hills Road
We reach Savannahbrooke’s [9]
We’ll find everyone with signs
But can it fit us all? [10]
(It’s another day of fun)
Do-we have to do on calls?
(It’s another day of fun)
Can we still drink at all?
Oh it’s another day of fun!

LYRICS EXPLANATIONS:

[1] General comment about how clinical school (Years 4-6) is a totally different experience to undergrad (Years 1-3) and so everyone’s unsure as to what’s going on
[2] CPC = Clinical Pathological Conference. Most of our 2-hour clinical pathology lectures take this format, with a panel of experts from various specialities related to the topic (eg: radiology, histopathology, respiratory etc)
[3] Reference to ‘placements’ where we get sent off for 6 weeks at a time to various hospitals around the East Anglia region.
[4] Kings Lynn is famously the furthest away (1h30m drive from Cambridge), and so it’s fashionable to complain about it.
[5] We also get sent off on GP placements, some of which can be up to 2h30m drive away from Cambridge. If you’re unlucky and get put somewhere far away and don’t have a car, you might have to travel for up to 4 hours on public transport to get there…
[6] GMC = General Medical Council. 
[7] “Signs” refers to physical attributes that some patients might have when you examine them. For example, a “distended abdomen” is a 
[8] Addenbrooke’s hospital is around 2 miles from Cambridge town centre. Students living in town (as opposed to further out) have a ~20 minute cycle to get there each morning.
[9] “Savannahbrooke’s” is where our pantomime is set. It’s a magical world where all the doctors and patients are animas, hence all the face paint. 
[10] One of the running gags in this year’s pantomime was the increased intake of clinical students, prompting jokes about capacity issues.

In this video, we talk about what to do if you don't get any offers for Medicine, or if you don't make your offers. It's a tricky and difficult position to be in, but we can't change what's happened, so it's important to look to the future and figure out an action plan.

In today's episode, we learn how to save lives in the Immediate Life Support course run by the Resuscitation Council UK. This was a super useful day on our Emergency Medicine placement. After the course finished, some of the junior doctors run a teaching session for us in the doctors' mess, and we finish the day with a game of Pandemic Legacy and some excellent home-cooked food.

In this video, we'll be discussing some of the ethical and legal issues raised by the case of Charlie Gard. Charlie (4 August 2016 – 28 July 2017) was born with a rare, incurable and life-limiting disease called MDDS. His case became controversial because the medical team and parents disagreed about whether experimental treatment was in Charlie's best interests. 

Abi and I are 6th year medical students at Cambridge University, and in this video we've tried to introduce you to some of the issues that Charlie's case brought up. We've made every effort to check our facts, and have referenced a number of useful resources (that we ourselves used) below. If we've made any mistakes, or if you disagree with our analyses, please do comment below - we'd love to learn from you.

Interview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. 

Content Note - Candid discussions about suicide and euthanasia.

In this video, we take a look at the ethics and law behind family- and physician-assisted suicide. We start with a discussion about family-assisted suicide, and introduce 3 well-known cases that helped shape or illustrate the UK's law around it. We then discuss Lord Falconer's (failed) Assisted Dying bill briefly, before turning to a discussion of the arguments for/against legalising physician-assisted suicide (euthanasia). 

As I mention in the 'future' segment around 00:48, the stuff about family-assisted suicide, and the cases of Diane Pretty, Debbie Purdy and Daniel James, are probably well outside the scope of what you 'need to know' for medicine interviews. If you're just here for some focused medicine interview prep (and there's nothing wrong with that), you'll get the most value from the final 10 minutes of the video starting at 16:50. But if you're interested in the topic generally, then hopefully you'll find the entirety of the video enlightening.

TIMESTAMPS:

16:50 - The ethics of euthanasia / assisted suicide - This is the most important and relevant bit for medicine interviews. The rest is for general interest mostly, and probably not directly helpful for interviews.

6med is a company that my friends and I have been running since 2013. We've taught courses on interviews, BMAT and UKCAT to ~5,000 students with glowing reviews. As we graduate from medical school and become real doctors, we didn't want our course material to go to waste, so we're making YouTube videos on everything we know and releasing them over time.

As promised, here's the long-awaited video about my 2018 university desk setup. I use it for work (I'm a medical student in case you haven't heard), video editing, web design and development (www.6med.co.uk), watching stuff on the internet and pretty much everything else. 

This is something I've wanted to do for a while, but doesn't neatly fit into the usual 'medicine application advice' or 'life of a medical student vlog' that the rest of my videos fall under.

Interview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. 

In this video, we discuss the legal side of euthanasia/physician assisted suicide. To summarise - euthanasia is illegal in the UK. 'Passive euthanasia' is a confusing term which we should avoid. 'Withdrawing medical treatment' is good medical practice when done appropriately, and is NOT the same thing as 'euthanasia'. 

Throughout the video we talk through the case of Dr Cox and Lillian Boyes which illustrates a lot of these points and is pretty seminal as far as legal cases go.

CORRECTIONS:

In Re T (Jehovah’s witness case) it was the refusal that was deemed invalid, not the original consent (Molly said that the consent was found invalid). 

And in the case of Nigel Cox, he was found guilty of attempted murder, not of manslaughter as we say (at 12.48). 

Profound apologies for the inaccuracies, and many thanks to Dr Fistein from the Cambridge Clinical School faculty for pointing out the errors.

This episode of The Vlog is loosely based around a day preparing for the Situational Judgment Test (SJT). We roam a little around Cambridge with camera in-hand, do a group revision session at a friend's house, meet with a Consultant transplant surgeon to discuss an app idea, and end with a trip to the ADC Theatre to see the Cambridge University Show Choir performing. Enjoy xx

PS: Chronologically, these events happen between episode 17 and 18. I've changed up the order a bit because I wanted the Christmas-themed videos to come out around Christmas time :)

Interview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. 

This video covers the basics (and some advanced stuff) about how to answer medical ethics scenarios. We're deliberately giving you more than you 'need to know', because hopefully if you're watching this video, you want to stand out in your medicine interviews rather than scraping by :) 

We discuss a medical ethics scenario that I got in my Imperial interview, using the 4 principles approach. We then expand on those a bit, giving you some tidbits that you can throw into your medical ethics answers to get brownie points with your interviewers. Finally, we end with a discussion of where the 4 principles of ethics actually come from, briefly explaining the meaning of virtue ethics, deontology and utilitarianism.

Towards the end of this video, I talk about a patient who died that evening. The team tried resuscitation, but were sadly unsuccessful. 

Most of my videos about 'life as a medical student' paint quite a positive, almost airbrushed picture of what it's like.

However, given the number of medicine applicants who seem to be watching these videos, it seems unfair to only offer the rose-tinted view. 

As such, I won't be shying away from the heavier issues like death and dying that we, as medical professionals, are immensely privileged to be a part of. I hope to be able to talk about them in a sensitive manner, and hope that you'll see these segments in an educational and reflective light.

CLOSING THOUGHTS - 

Being part of the team that evening was a privilege that I'll never forget.

Our patient got the best possible care, but sadly, wasn't able to be resuscitated.

Death is an unavoidable part of being a doctor (and indeed, of being human). But too often, we're afraid of it, reluctant to talk about it with patients and families. 

I'm sure, over the course of my career, I'll meet many more patients who will die. I hope to learn from each, and to share some of that experience with you. 

My thoughts and prayers are with our patient and her family. May she rest in peace.

This episode focuses on our 3-day adventure at SWMUK (Students Wilderness Medicine UK), a conference for medical students and paramedics interested in expedition/wilderness/mountain medicine. We camped out in some random field in Nottingham for 2 nights, attended some inspiring talks and workshops, and had a generally great time. 

This whole wilderness medicine thing is something I'd never imagined myself wanting to do, until I got involved with CUWMS (Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society) in 4th year. Now I think I'd really like to explore this avenue of medicine further, and as such, this conference was a really eye-opening experience.

We talk about 5 questions to ask yourself to work out whether you'd enjoy the style of learning at Cambridge, and then talk a bit about concerns people have about the Cambridge 'stereotype' (whatever that means to you).

NB: Oxford and Cambridge are very very similar, so everything in this video also applies to Oxford. The course at Oxford is also very academic, and the stereotypes equally apply (if not more so).

A 3-day highlight reel of the Cambridge International Mental Health Conference that we attended and presented our paper at. We had a great time over the 3 days, had some wonderful food, and ended up winning 2nd prize for our presentation. It was even dubbed 'the most amusing presentation of the day', high praise from the organisers of the conference. Enjoy xx

A random day of Senior Medicine placement, where we go to the gym, hang out on the wards, have a teaching session, realise we're addicted to Everwing (a Facebook messenger game) and play Pandemic (an awesome board game).

Part II of our wilderness medicine expedition with the Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society (CUWMS). We kick things off with a nighttime medical emergency at the campsite, followed by a quick debrief, and then an artsy montage of the final day of trekking around the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park.

The wilderness medicine trips will definitely be one aspect of Cambridge medical student life that I'll miss the most when it's over. These vlogs will hopefully be a way to relive the wonder one day when we're all jaded from the grind of doctor life.

Huge thanks again to everyone who went on the trip - you guys were awesome :)

A trip to Yorkshire Dales National Park with the Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society (CUWMS). Each term, we do a couple of trips to various pretty parts of the UK. We spend the weekend hiking through mountains, doing the occasional medical scenario, eat lots of food and play lots of group bonding games like Mafia, Articulate and more. 

Massive thanks to everyone who went on the trip for (a) being awesome and friendly and lovely, and (b) being cool with a fat camera pointed at their face for a lot of it. Love you guys xx
