I used to get hit with writer‚Äôs block constantly. Now, I‚Äôm VoicePalling my ideas: I grab my phone, go for a walk, and let VoicePal capture my thoughts while I get my steps in.

There‚Äôs something about being outdoors that just makes ideas flow easier. Walking, breathing fresh air, taking in the surroundings‚Äîit‚Äôs not about ‚Äòwriting‚Äô anymore, but just talking through my ideas. Then VoicePal turns it all into a first draft that actually sounds like me.

If you‚Äôre ready to try a new way of ‚Äòwriting‚Äô that feels more like a walk in the park (literally), search VoicePal on the App Store or Play Store :)

Hey friends. So this is a 3 hour evidence-based studying course that I filmed a few years ago and put on Skillshare, but now I want to make it available to everyone for free. In this class, I'll take you through the well-kept secrets of how to study effectively and organise your workflow to be ready for exams when they come around. We'll also discuss why studying effectively and efficiently is one of the best ways to maintain a work-life balance. 

We'll break down (1) how to understand our content using techniques like the Feynman Method, Active Recall and various note-taking strategies, (2) how to remember our material with Spaced Repetition, Interleaving and various memory techniques, and (3) how to maintain focus while studying, from developing the motivation and discipline to do the work, to taking appropriate breaks and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

T6hmdrsLQj8,How to Build Your Ultimate Productivity System,"üìö Pre-order my book to get an exclusive ticket to The Feel-Good Productivity Annual Planning Workshop in January 2024! https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/?utm_campaign=bonus&utm_source=youtube_long&utm_medium=video_description&utm_content=How+to+Build+the+Ultimate+Productivity+System+%282023%29

The whole point of a productivity system is to get your life in order and free up valuable brain space. No one wants to be spending tons of time organising emails or searching for a book quote that they forgot to highlight. 

There are broadly three levels of building an ultimate productivity system: keeping your life in order, capturing new info, and creating a system around it. You can stop at layer one or use all three. I cover it all in more detail in this video, including suggestions for apps that I like to use daily.

ngWZaSbw130,Why Buying Is Not Always Better Than Renting,"So you've probably heard the phrase ""renting is money down the drain"" and you've probably been told your whole life, that you should get on the property ladder and buy a home, because once you've bought a home, then you're saving money and it's an investment and stuff, and hey, at least you're not renting anymore and throwing all that money away. 

BUT it's actually a lot more complicated than that. BOTH buying and renting have costs, both financial and psychological, and those are the factors we need to take into account which I'll be discussing in this episode of Money Club.

mVR_nLBeS24,"Which iPad Should You Buy? (Basic, Mini, Air, Pro or Pro 12.9)","In this video, I'll be going over all the iPad models out there in 2022 and which would be the best to buy right now as a consumer, creator or professional.

My upfront conclusion is that if you're a consumer/student then the basic iPad is your best friend. If you're a light creator then you should probably go with the iPad Air (2022, M1) and if you're a creator / professional of some kind, then the iPad Pro (11"" & 12.9"") is for you.

nQggHK36gK8,"Reviewing Kindles - Standard, Paperwhite, Signature, Oasis","Try out Loom, the screen recording software the team and I use daily üëâ  https://loom.com/aliabdaal

Hey friends, in this video, we're taking a quick look at Amazon's newly released Kindles and which one I recommend you buy for 2022! Upfront, my conclusion is that you should go for the Paperwhite, but the standard kindle is also pretty good and much cheaper, it just comes with a few compromises. The Signature and Oasis are both pretty ridiculous unless you have money to burn or a very niche use-case. Hopefully this video helps with your decision! Enjoy xx

Toz7XEsSH_o,How Much Money I Make as a YouTuber (2021)üí∞,"If you want to start or grow a channel, check out my Part-Time YouTuber Academy here: https://ptya.com/part-time-youtuber-academy

In this ridiculously long and detailed video, I'll take you behind-the-scenes of my YouTube channel and various businesses to show how much money we've made in 2021. Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account and please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty.

If you've got any questions, chuck them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer. 

PS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it goes into a company account which I then pay 21 team members, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions etc. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this ""top line business revenue"" has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :)

I never used to be a huge fan of goals. They just seemed a bit pointless compared to the value of a robust system. But over the past year speaking to different experts, I've come to realise that there may be more to this whole goal thing than I previously thought.

In this ridiculously long and detailed video, I'll take you behind-the-scenes of my Youtube channel and various businesses to show how much money we've made in 2020. Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account. And please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty. 

If you've got any questions, chuck them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer. 

üß† The Part-Time YouTuber Academy - https://academy.aliabdaal.com

PS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it all goes into a company account. Then I pay salaries for 2.5 full time employees, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this ""top line business revenue"" has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :)

In this episode of book club we're looking at the best selling book The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday which looks at how we use the ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism to help us turn adversity to our advantage. In the video, we look at the three key areas that Ryan identifies as key to this process - Perception, Action and Will - and discuss some examples of people who have successfully overcome adversity by leveraging the hidden benefits of obstacles to their advantage.

Hey friends, I'm pleased to bring you my latest SkillShare class that's being released today - How to Be Happier - A Stoicism Masterclass. I've taken great value from some of the principles of Stoicism over the past few years and so I decided to get together with my friend Sam, who is an expert on the ancient Greek philosophy, to put together this class. Over the course of 12 lessons, we explore the key themes of Stoicism as well as explain how to apply Stoic principles to your own life to foster happier and healthier lives as a result. I really hope you enjoy it!

Giving What We Can: https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/

‚ÄúI recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.‚Äù #TakeThePledge #GivingWhatWeCan

To improve your thinking and learning skills with active recall, visit https://brilliant.org/ali and sign up for free. The first 200 people will get 20% off the annual Premium subscription :)

In this video, we're taking a look at the method that my friend Osaid used to rank 1st at Cambridge University Medical School. He was consistently in the top 3 overall, and ranked 1st in several subjects using this method. It involves taking Active Recall to its logical extreme (the most efficient study technique, backed by decades of evidence).

If you've dreamed of starting a YouTube channel but haven't got an expensive camera and gear yet, this video's for you. We talk over my top tips for filming quality videos with your iPhone / Android using the app Filmic Pro. The audio is probably the most important part - I'd highly recommend using the Rode VideoMicro to start with, and you can always graduate to an external audio setup (like I have) later on. Good luck with your journey!

Lots of the comments were about money and relationships, but there were a few about how I'm going bald, how arrogant I come across in videos and how I probably went to private school.

In this video, I discuss the 4 main ways in which I use my iPad Pro in my daily work as a junior doctor. I talk about (1) how I use Goodnotes and the Dash Plus Productivity System to manage my to-do lists, (2) the magic of electronic medical records, (3) the power of being able to look stuff up on the fly, and (4) the beauty of productive downtime. Enjoy xx

PS: Eagle-eyed viewers might realise that this is a re-upload. The original video I posted in early 2019 missed the mark in terms of taking issues like data protection seriously. I hope this new version addresses some of those issues while also showing what a benefit technology like the iPad provides in clinical settings.

In today's Tech Tuesdays, we discuss recommendations for which iPad is best for which people. I conclude that the iPad Mini is best for those who use an iPad for purely consumption purposes, but if you're a student, or if you use it for any creative purposes, you'd probably be best served with the iPad Air (2019). 

If you're on a tight budget, the iPad ($319) is a pretty solid shout, and if you have a tonne of spare cash to burn, you can't get much better than the iPad Pro.

Hey friends! Today marks the start of a new experimental series on the channel - I explain fully in the video, but basically, I'm starting a podcast. It'll be called ""Intercourse"" with the subtitle something like ""Conversations about everyday life"". 

In this episode, I chat with fellow Cambridge YouTuber Parth G about lessons that we learned while at university. There's a second video on his channel of the two of us chatting about study tips which you might like to check out:

In this interview, I talk to Anton, a 6th year medical student at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Anton got 4 rejections the first time he applied, but he tactically worked on his application and got an offer from Cambridge University after taking a gap year. In this video, Anton addresses a load of questions that you‚Äôll hopefully find helpful if you‚Äôre reapplying to medicine.

Slightly different episode from the usual today. A little while ago, I spent a few days in Grenada, an island in the Caribbean. On one of the days, I visited St George's University, a medical school in the capital city to experience life as a medical student in Grenada. I had a wonderful time being shown around by an old friend, and got some pretty sweet shots of the beautiful island. Enjoy xx

In this video, we talk about my strategy for taking notes with the iPad and Apple Pencil. I use an iPad Pro but would probably recommend the new 2018 iPad with Apple Pencil if you're buying a new one. We talk about the benefits of taking notes with an iPad vs traditional methods, we talk about Notability vs OneNote (I prefer Notability), and I share various techniques of note-taking that I use in lectures, seminars and hospital placements.

tBANvzdbY_s,We Just Can‚Äôt Wait to Begin - The Prion King | Addenbrooke‚Äôs Hospital Pantomime 2018,"THE ADDENBROOKE‚ÄôS PANTOMIME

Each year, clinical medical students (Years 4-6) at Cambridge University put on a pantomime to raise money for charity. In 2018, we performed ‚ÄúThe Prion King‚Äù and raised over ¬£10,000 for the Addenbrooke‚Äôs Charitable Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres. 

It follows the story of Simbastatin (a 4th year medical student) and his friends as they navigate their first experiences of life on the wards. The evil villain Scarcoma (a paediatric surgeon-turned forensic pathologist) and his team of feral politicians plot to overthrow the dean of the Cambridge clinical school by unleashing the deadly Prion Disease. 

Each year, panto is written, directed, arranged, choreographed and performed by medical students. It‚Äôs always an incredible experience for those of us involved in it, and a great way of making friends across year groups. This year, for the first time, we‚Äôre putting the musical performances up on YouTube - enjoy!

SONG #2 - WE JUST CAN‚ÄôT WAIT TO BEGIN

The second song introduces our main cast of ‚Äògood guys‚Äô - Simbastatin, Naloxone, Cornelius, Shelly and Minnie, as well as a load of other students all placed on the same ward in the hospital. The students are filled with naive joy about what life in clinical school is like, and expect they‚Äôll be saving lives as an integral part of the clinical team on a daily basis. This song is a culmination of their continued optimism.

OTHER SONGS:

1. Another day of fun (La La Land) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-QC4mT8bXA
2. We just can‚Äôt wait to begin (The Lion King) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBANvzdbY_s

LYRICS:

[NALA] Clinical school‚Äôs finally here,
The day we‚Äôve waited for 
[SIMBA] It‚Äôs gonna rule that much is clear
Preclin was such a bore

[SIMBA] I bet this is a piece of cake, 
The wards sound like a laugh,
[RAFIKI] Just wait until you‚Äôre an F1
We‚Äôre always understaffed

[ALL] Lectures prepared us for anything
Oh we just can‚Äôt wait to begin!

[MINNIE] Ordering blood tests
([SHELLY] what was that dear?)
[NALA] Analysing CTs
([SIMBA] what are they?)
[CORNELIUS] chatting up patients
([ZAZUSAN] excuse me?)
[S, N, M, C, Sh] It‚Äôll be a bre--eze
([ZAZU] now see here!)

[S, N, M, C, Sh] Always finish by midday
([ZAZU] A patient a day keeps failure--(interrupted))
[S, N, M, C, Sh] We‚Äôll have so much time to play

[CORNELIUS] (arm over Nala) I wonder if on my first day I‚Äôll break a patient‚Äôs heart
[NALA] First you‚Äôd need a bath and sort that smell out for a start

[DOCTOR] (surrounded by ridiculous number of students) If this is where our hospital 
Is headed, count me out!
I hate students
And Savannahbrooke‚Äôs 
There‚Äôs private work about!!

[ZAZU] (flaps after her) We‚Äôre sending half the students to King‚Äôs Lynn!
[ALL] Oh we just can‚Äôt wait to begin!

[Sh+C] Learning on the ward rounds
[MINNIE] Helping run the clinics
[SIMBA] Acting in the theatres (everyone stares at him)
[NALA] Simba you are so thick (friendly)

[ALL] We‚Äôre finally meeting patients what a dream
Consultants will all want us on their team
We‚Äôre gonna save so many lives, you‚Äôll see
Oh we just can‚Äôt wait to begin!
Oh we just can‚Äôt wait to begin!
Oh we just can‚Äôt wait to begin!

G-QC4mT8bXA,Another Day of Fun (La La Land) - The Prion King | Addenbrooke‚Äôs Hospital Pantomime 2018,"THE ADDENBROOKE‚ÄôS PANTOMIME

Each year, clinical medical students (Years 4-6) at Cambridge University put on a pantomime to raise money for charity. In 2018, we performed ‚ÄúThe Prion King‚Äù and raised over ¬£10,000 for the Addenbrooke‚Äôs Charitable Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres. 

It follows the story of Simbastatin (a 4th year medical student) and his friends as they navigate their first experiences of life on the wards. The evil villain Scarcoma (a paediatric surgeon-turned forensic pathologist) and his team of feral politicians plot to overthrow the dean of the Cambridge clinical school by unleashing the deadly Prion Disease. 

Each year, panto is written, directed, arranged, choreographed and performed by medical students. It‚Äôs always an incredible experience for those of us involved in it, and a great way of making friends across year groups. This year, for the first time, we‚Äôre putting the musical performances up on YouTube - enjoy!

SONG #1 - ANOTHER DAY OF FUN

The opening number shows the new 4th year clinical students arriving in Savannahbrooke‚Äôs Hospital and trying to navigate their new environment. They‚Äôve spent the past 3 years of preclinical medicine practically living in the library, but are about to meet real patients for the first time. Filled with blind optimism, they burst into La La Land-inspired song. It‚Äôs another day of fun.

LYRICS:
(Explanations in footnotes)

We‚Äôre back for our first day
We‚Äôre going to start clinical school
Patients better pray
We are so excited, but we still don‚Äôt have a clue
No one has told us what to do
We wish we knew [1]

Summer‚Äôs at an end
These CPC‚Äôs [2] are going to 
Drive me around the bend,
And my placement plan [3]
Just seems so random and bizarre, 
I think I‚Äôm gonna need a car
King‚Äôs Lynn [4] is way too far!

Hope my GP‚Äôs somewhere near [5]
Is he even in our year?
Not sure what I‚Äôm doing here
We‚Äôll have to see

What the hell‚Äôs the GMC? [6]
Are they friend or foe to me?
Where do I find my ward? 
Do I have to go in?!

In hospital
Always have to run
So we find everyone with signs [7]                                                                                                            
Why‚Äôd I live in town? [8]
(It‚Äôs another day of fun)
I‚Äôm always late and now
(It‚Äôs another day of fun)
This lanyard‚Äôs going brown
And it‚Äôs another day of fun!

Climb Hills Road
We reach Savannahbrooke‚Äôs [9]
We‚Äôll find everyone with signs
But can it fit us all? [10]
(It‚Äôs another day of fun)
Do-we have to do on calls?
(It‚Äôs another day of fun)
Can we still drink at all?
Oh it‚Äôs another day of fun!

LYRICS EXPLANATIONS:

[1] General comment about how clinical school (Years 4-6) is a totally different experience to undergrad (Years 1-3) and so everyone‚Äôs unsure as to what‚Äôs going on
[2] CPC = Clinical Pathological Conference. Most of our 2-hour clinical pathology lectures take this format, with a panel of experts from various specialities related to the topic (eg: radiology, histopathology, respiratory etc)
[3] Reference to ‚Äòplacements‚Äô where we get sent off for 6 weeks at a time to various hospitals around the East Anglia region.
[4] Kings Lynn is famously the furthest away (1h30m drive from Cambridge), and so it‚Äôs fashionable to complain about it.
[5] We also get sent off on GP placements, some of which can be up to 2h30m drive away from Cambridge. If you‚Äôre unlucky and get put somewhere far away and don‚Äôt have a car, you might have to travel for up to 4 hours on public transport to get there‚Ä¶
[6] GMC = General Medical Council. 
[7] ‚ÄúSigns‚Äù refers to physical attributes that some patients might have when you examine them. For example, a ‚Äúdistended abdomen‚Äù is a 
[8] Addenbrooke‚Äôs hospital is around 2 miles from Cambridge town centre. Students living in town (as opposed to further out) have a ~20 minute cycle to get there each morning.
[9] ‚ÄúSavannahbrooke‚Äôs‚Äù is where our pantomime is set. It‚Äôs a magical world where all the doctors and patients are animas, hence all the face paint. 
[10] One of the running gags in this year‚Äôs pantomime was the increased intake of clinical students, prompting jokes about capacity issues.

In this video, we'll be discussing some of the ethical and legal issues raised by the case of Charlie Gard. Charlie (4 August 2016 ‚Äì 28 July 2017) was born with a rare, incurable and life-limiting disease called MDDS. His case became controversial because the medical team and parents disagreed about whether experimental treatment was in Charlie's best interests. 

Abi and I are 6th year medical students at Cambridge University, and in this video we've tried to introduce you to some of the issues that Charlie's case brought up. We've made every effort to check our facts, and have referenced a number of useful resources (that we ourselves used) below. If we've made any mistakes, or if you disagree with our analyses, please do comment below - we'd love to learn from you.

Interview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. 

Content Note - Candid discussions about suicide and euthanasia.

In this video, we take a look at the ethics and law behind family- and physician-assisted suicide. We start with a discussion about family-assisted suicide, and introduce 3 well-known cases that helped shape or illustrate the UK's law around it. We then discuss Lord Falconer's (failed) Assisted Dying bill briefly, before turning to a discussion of the arguments for/against legalising physician-assisted suicide (euthanasia). 

As I mention in the 'future' segment around 00:48, the stuff about family-assisted suicide, and the cases of Diane Pretty, Debbie Purdy and Daniel James, are probably well outside the scope of what you 'need to know' for medicine interviews. If you're just here for some focused medicine interview prep (and there's nothing wrong with that), you'll get the most value from the final 10 minutes of the video starting at 16:50. But if you're interested in the topic generally, then hopefully you'll find the entirety of the video enlightening.

TIMESTAMPS:

16:50 - The ethics of euthanasia / assisted suicide - This is the most important and relevant bit for medicine interviews. The rest is for general interest mostly, and probably not directly helpful for interviews.

As promised, here's the long-awaited video about my 2018 university desk setup. I use it for work (I'm a medical student in case you haven't heard), video editing, web design and development (www.6med.co.uk), watching stuff on the internet and pretty much everything else. 

This is something I've wanted to do for a while, but doesn't neatly fit into the usual 'medicine application advice' or 'life of a medical student vlog' that the rest of my videos fall under.

Interview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. 

In this video, we discuss the legal side of euthanasia/physician assisted suicide. To summarise - euthanasia is illegal in the UK. 'Passive euthanasia' is a confusing term which we should avoid. 'Withdrawing medical treatment' is good medical practice when done appropriately, and is NOT the same thing as 'euthanasia'. 

Throughout the video we talk through the case of Dr Cox and Lillian Boyes which illustrates a lot of these points and is pretty seminal as far as legal cases go.

CORRECTIONS:

In Re T (Jehovah‚Äôs witness case) it was the refusal that was deemed invalid, not the original consent (Molly said that the consent was found invalid). 

And in the case of Nigel Cox, he was found guilty of attempted murder, not of manslaughter as we say (at 12.48). 

Profound apologies for the inaccuracies, and many thanks to Dr Fistein from the Cambridge Clinical School faculty for pointing out the errors.

This episode of The Vlog is loosely based around a day preparing for the Situational Judgment Test (SJT). We roam a little around Cambridge with camera in-hand, do a group revision session at a friend's house, meet with a Consultant transplant surgeon to discuss an app idea, and end with a trip to the ADC Theatre to see the Cambridge University Show Choir performing. Enjoy xx

PS: Chronologically, these events happen between episode 17 and 18. I've changed up the order a bit because I wanted the Christmas-themed videos to come out around Christmas time :)

This video covers the basics (and some advanced stuff) about how to answer medical ethics scenarios. We're deliberately giving you more than you 'need to know', because hopefully if you're watching this video, you want to stand out in your medicine interviews rather than scraping by :) 

We discuss a medical ethics scenario that I got in my Imperial interview, using the 4 principles approach. We then expand on those a bit, giving you some tidbits that you can throw into your medical ethics answers to get brownie points with your interviewers. Finally, we end with a discussion of where the 4 principles of ethics actually come from, briefly explaining the meaning of virtue ethics, deontology and utilitarianism.

Most of my videos about 'life as a medical student' paint quite a positive, almost airbrushed picture of what it's like.

However, given the number of medicine applicants who seem to be watching these videos, it seems unfair to only offer the rose-tinted view. 

As such, I won't be shying away from the heavier issues like death and dying that we, as medical professionals, are immensely privileged to be a part of. I hope to be able to talk about them in a sensitive manner, and hope that you'll see these segments in an educational and reflective light.

CLOSING THOUGHTS - 

Being part of the team that evening was a privilege that I'll never forget.

Our patient got the best possible care, but sadly, wasn't able to be resuscitated.

Death is an unavoidable part of being a doctor (and indeed, of being human). But too often, we're afraid of it, reluctant to talk about it with patients and families. 

I'm sure, over the course of my career, I'll meet many more patients who will die. I hope to learn from each, and to share some of that experience with you. 

My thoughts and prayers are with our patient and her family. May she rest in peace.

This episode focuses on our 3-day adventure at SWMUK (Students Wilderness Medicine UK), a conference for medical students and paramedics interested in expedition/wilderness/mountain medicine. We camped out in some random field in Nottingham for 2 nights, attended some inspiring talks and workshops, and had a generally great time. 

This whole wilderness medicine thing is something I'd never imagined myself wanting to do, until I got involved with CUWMS (Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society) in 4th year. Now I think I'd really like to explore this avenue of medicine further, and as such, this conference was a really eye-opening experience.

If you're thinking of applying to Cambridge (or Oxford) for Medicine, you might find this video useful :)

We talk about 5 questions to ask yourself to work out whether you'd enjoy the style of learning at Cambridge, and then talk a bit about concerns people have about the Cambridge 'stereotype' (whatever that means to you).

NB: Oxford and Cambridge are very very similar, so everything in this video also applies to Oxford. The course at Oxford is also very academic, and the stereotypes equally apply (if not more so).

A random day of Senior Medicine placement, where we go to the gym, hang out on the wards, have a teaching session, realise we're addicted to Everwing (a Facebook messenger game) and play Pandemic (an awesome board game).

Part II of our wilderness medicine expedition with the Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society (CUWMS). We kick things off with a nighttime medical emergency at the campsite, followed by a quick debrief, and then an artsy montage of the final day of trekking around the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park.

The wilderness medicine trips will definitely be one aspect of Cambridge medical student life that I'll miss the most when it's over. These vlogs will hopefully be a way to relive the wonder one day when we're all jaded from the grind of doctor life.

Huge thanks again to everyone who went on the trip - you guys were awesome :)

A trip to Yorkshire Dales National Park with the Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society (CUWMS). Each term, we do a couple of trips to various pretty parts of the UK. We spend the weekend hiking through mountains, doing the occasional medical scenario, eat lots of food and play lots of group bonding games like Mafia, Articulate and more. 

Massive thanks to everyone who went on the trip for (a) being awesome and friendly and lovely, and (b) being cool with a fat camera pointed at their face for a lot of it. Love you guys xx
